# Loan_Approval_prediction

ðŸš€ Excited to announce my latest project! ðŸš€

After a long period of time, I am thrilled to share my new project on loan-approval prediction. This project tackles the binary classification problem of predicting loan approvals, and I have experimented with various models to determine which one delivers the best accuracy.

The models I explored include:

ðŸ”¹ Logistic Regression  
ðŸ”¹ K-Neighbors  
ðŸ”¹ Naive Bayes  
ðŸ”¹ Random Forest  
ðŸ”¹ Gradient Boosting  
ðŸ”¹ Decision Tree

After extensive testing and evaluation, I found that *Naive Bayes* performed exceptionally well, surpassing the other models in terms of accuracy. ðŸŽ‰

This project has been an incredible learning experience, and I'm excited to continue building on this knowledge and applying it to future challenges.

Stay tuned for more updates!
